            <h3>1. Petra</h3>
            <img src="jordan-top-attractions-petra.jpg">
            <p>Prepare to be amazed by Petra. One of the<b>New7Wonders</b> of the World,
                this attraction has wowed modern-day visitors since the long-lost city's rediscovery by 
                Swiss explorer Jean Louis Burckhardt more than 200 years ago.
                You'll need at least two days to hit all the highlights around Petra,
                 which include more than 800 registered sites.</p>

            <h3>2. Dead Sea</h3>
            <img src="jordan-top-attractions-dead-sea.jpg" >
            <p>Floating in the Dead Sea is a quintessential thing to do in Jordan. 
               The lowest point on Earth accessible by road, this body of water is located at 418 meters below sea level.
                It practically glows an intense shade of aquamarine â€“ a particularly striking sight next
                 to salt-encrusted rock ledges and barren red mountains in the background.
                You can reach the attractions in the Dead Sea region in about an hour by car from Amman.</p>
                <div><b>Hot tip:</b> Avoid getting Dead Sea water in your eyes at all costs. The intense salinity (10 times saltier than the ocean!) 
                  stings worse than you can imagine.</div>

               <h3>3. Wadi Rum</h3>
         <img src="jordan-top-attractions-wadi-rum.jpg">
         <p>Head to the southern region of Jordan, and you'll be treated to one of the most spectacular landscapes across the globe: Wadi Rum. 
            Also known as the Valley of the Moon, this sandstone and granite rock valley is an otherworldly experience,
             with towering cliffs, massive dunes,swirling archways, and caverns. It served as the set for much of the 1962 
             film Lawrence of Arabia and was tagged a<b>UNESCO</b> World Heritage Site in 2011.
         </p>
           <h3>4. Jerash Ruins</h3>
           <img src="jordan-top-attractions-jerash-ruins.jpg">
           <p>Nothing feels more like traveling back in time than visiting the Jerash ruins. It's one of the world's best-preserved ancient Roman cities 
            and features spectacular places to visit, from colonnaded avenues and temples to a massive sports arena that once had a seating capacity of 15,000 spectators.</p>
            <div><b>Hot tip:</b> There's almost no shade in this archeological site. Bring plenty of water,
                sunscreen, and a sunhat to keep yourself protected from the harsh rays.</div>
      
             <h3>5. Aqaba</h3>
             <img src="jordan-top-attractions-aqaba.jpg">
             <p>Think you can't have a seaside vacation in the hot, dry Middle East? Think again. Aqaba, a beach town on the southern tip of Jordan, 
               treats tourists to holidays on the breathtaking coastline of the Red Sea.</p>
               <p>
               Float, swim, snorkel, or dive you can do it all from Aqaba. You can also get out on the turquoise water on one of the daily 
               cruises offered by local hotels. Enhance your beach vacation in Jordan with a soak in one of the lovely hammams around the resort town</p>
